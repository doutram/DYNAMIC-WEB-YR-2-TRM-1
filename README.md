###What I did during the making of the app

For this project the brief was to create an app that filters throught data `the main guidlines for the app was ""something for someone"` so there where many ideas for this app although some was out of my skill range so i deciced i wanted to create a location based app because its still pushing my abilitys in coding.

#####Ideas    
At first i wanted to do a app that would help you find retail shops that are simular to your style
the only problem with this was that in my formative i realised that google does the exact thing but better and there was no way to do it better so matteo helped me by `giving me a task of coming up with ten ideas so here they are:`

1. `Take a Photo of an item and it tells you where it stocks their clothes`
This app is designed for people that see some one the tube or around London and take a picture of it and it searches for similar clothing or the item and shows you where it stocks them i was mainly going to use this for shoes.</p>
2. `the perfect Pixer x vans shoe`
this Idea is to make an app where you can choose if you are female or male and the choose your age and your favorite character from toy story and it will generate you perfect pixer x vans shoe.

3. `pubs for people craving a beverage`
i believe this one has already been invented but i wanted to create an app where you can search your location and it tells you all of the nearest drinking places and the average prices for beer and spirits.

4. `html and css game? for people want to know/learn how to code html and css`
This is a really good idea although i dont think it fits the brief so i am going to create it as a project to do on the side the idea is coding is a lot of fun but remembering some code can be challenging so the app will help you by each level you will get a questing like how to create an anchor point then it will give you the options if you choose wrong it will take you to a page where it will tell you the correct answer so when you get to that level hopefully you would have remembered and so on if you kept getting answers wrong you will have to redo every level again which would drill the code in to your head.

5. `skate parks for skateboarders`
This Idea has defiantly been done before as you can see in my first blog so basically the way the app works is that you search your location and it will show you the nearest skateparks and the prices and reviews.</p>

6. `fastfood finder`
have you ever been somewhere and thought theres all these expensive restaurants around and i dont want to sit down and have a pricy meal i just want a cheap on the go burger well this app does that once again you search your location and it will show you the nearest fast food places and there menus and opening times.

7. `legal graffiti spots`
this app show artist where to paint legally in the uk i also thought you could add on a upload section on where they can upload images from where they painted to show of there artwork to over people in that subject.

8. `exhibitions in galleries`
this app is for people that want to know about all of the arty stuff that is going on in London and the prices and what artists are going to be showcasing there work in galleries in London.

9. `rocks for rock climbers` 
i also thought of an app where rock climbers can search there location and see different places nearby they can climb i think this idea is pretty cool as my dad has rock climbed nearly his whole life and he carrys his equiptment in the back of the car and anywhere we go he looks for ages and ages for a rock to climb imagine if he had an app what coulld tell him all of the good spots to go.

10. `skate board info for people new to skate boarding.`
So this is an idea i came up with when a close friend of mine decided to start skateboarding, now when you start skate boarding you think just buy a skate board and ride it well no you should do this because with skate boards theres all different types,shapes and sizes depending on what the use of the board would be and what size feet you are ,to begin with its a complicated thing that you need to under take before you go out a buy a skate board so ive decided to to this idea as it is useful.</p>

#####MY FINAL IDEA

So my final idea is to create a app that lets you find fast food places where you can quickly grab a bite to eat `my main target audience` will be people who are extremly busy and dont have time to cook dinner but dont want to spend way too much money one eating out.


#####Content    
so my all of my content is being taken from the .gov hygiene rating website i have decided to only use places with a hygiene rating of 1,2,3 the reason for this is because it needs to me `grubby,cheap and fast` and lets be honest those places are the places that are grubby.

#####research

######design research
So for my design research I went down old kent road which is king of greasy spoons i tried getting insparation because my original idea was to make my app look cheap and tacky to match the stores where they will going but the only problem i found with this was that making something look tacky and "grubby" actually makes the app look unapertising so i decided to create something alot more eye pleasing.

For color i was giong to use any color i found which would be pleasent but i decided to go with green because i thought it still gives a slightly healthy feel to it but obviously it isnt healthy but i didnt want to put anyone off of giong to these places to eat because they are cheap good and not actualy that bad they may look discusting at first but they actually produce good food.

######Target audience research
my target audience research was pretty easy because im one of these people who are constantly working and dont barely have time to cook dinner and i need something quick but i want it cheap because im a student and i dont want to go to burger king for a Â£8 burger so i need a small cheap fast food place but the problem with this is that they really show up on google maps .
